# CS 586 (Intro to Databases) Final Project

This repository contains the project files for my Intro to Databases final project from Portland State University. All work was completed in the Fall 2018 quarter. The data used for this project were pulled from [NewSpace Index](https://www.newspace.im/) under the terms of academic fair use. The Postgres 10 database created for the project is not publicly visible.

## Python to SQL

I wrote around 600 lines of Python to process the NewSpace Index data and produce the necessary INSERT statements programmatically. The Python code is available under [python](./python), along with the SQL files generated through Python and the TSV source files.

## LaTeX

I produced the reports for parts 1 and 3 with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) and have included the part 3 source files under [part3-latex](./part3-latex).

## Project Outline

Part 1: describe the data domain, decide on a data ingestion technique, and write 20 questions to answer with SQL queries.

Part 2: produce ER diagram, schema diagram, and evidence that I've created at least one table and inserted at least one row.

Part 3: final project report. Show ER diagram; show CREATE TABLE statements; describe how I populated the database; produce SQL responses to the 20 questions from part 1; produce full listing of the database by table.
